## Why this project?

After some time working with eCommerce platforms (mostly Magento). I decided to create an open-source eCommerce platform with Node. I want to build a lightweight platform that is easy to use and flexible to customize but still provides most of the key features that an eCommerce platform should have.

EverShop uses Node for the backend, and a client built with React. It also uses MySQL for database storage.
